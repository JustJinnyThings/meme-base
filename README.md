Hello! 
My name is Jin Zhao and this is where I'll be keeping my projects since they get way too disorganized in my document folder. I'm a senior at UNC Chapel Hill and I'm assuming if you found this page, you either got here from the link on the resume I gave you or you're a classmate that I'm doing a project with. That being said, my goal is to get a full time position or internship before I graduate May 2018! As much as I'm interested in web and software development, I'm also keen on the business side of technology as well as opportunities abroad!
Best,
Xiyuan Jin Zhao
